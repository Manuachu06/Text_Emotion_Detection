# Emotion Detection Based on Text Data

Welcome to the **Emotion Detection Based on Text Data** project!  
This repository contains a machine learning-based model that predicts human emotions from textual input such as sentences, comments, or reviews. The goal is to enable machines to better understand human feelings conveyed through written language.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we build a model that can classify a given piece of text into different emotional categories like **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **fear**, **love**, **surprise**, etc.  
This can be particularly useful in applications such as:

- Customer feedback analysis
- Social media monitoring
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Mental health support tools

---

## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning based classification models
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Simple API endpoint or CLI (optional extension)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `nltk` or `spaCy`
  - `TensorFlow` / `PyTorch` (for deep learning models)
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
  - Git and GitHub

## 🧠 Model Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Use an open-source emotion-labeled dataset or collect your own.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
3. **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (optional).
4. **Model Training**: Train ML/DL models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, BERT, etc.
5. **Evaluation**: Analyze model performance using confusion matrix and classification metrics.
6. **Deployment** (Optional): Build a simple REST API or web app to demonstrate the model.

## 📊 Example

**Input Text**:  
> "I'm so excited about my new job opportunity!"

**Predicted Emotion**:  
> `joy` / `happy`
